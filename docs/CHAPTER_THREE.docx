Focus group discussions with diverse user groups helped validate our findings and gather additional perspectives.

3.2.2 Analysis of the Existing System
Current competition management systems primarily rely on manual processes, creating significant inefficiencies. Event organizers struggle with paper-based registration systems and spreadsheet-based participant tracking, leading to data entry errors and time-consuming administrative tasks. Communication largely depends on email, resulting in delayed updates and missed information. The registration workflow often involves multiple manual steps, creating bottlenecks in the process.

3.2.3 Advantages of the Existing System
Despite its limitations, the current system offers certain advantages that users appreciate. Its simplicity makes it accessible to users with limited technical expertise, and the direct personal interaction helps build relationships with participants. The system's flexibility allows for easy process modifications without technical constraints. Additionally, the low initial setup costs and minimal maintenance requirements make it cost-effective for smaller organizations.

3.2.4 Disadvantages of the Existing System
However, the disadvantages of the existing system significantly impact operational efficiency. Manual processes are time-consuming and prone to errors, while limited scalability hinders growth. The lack of real-time updates affects communication effectiveness, and poor data security poses risks to sensitive information. These limitations particularly affect larger events and organizations looking to expand their operations.
