CHAPTER THREE

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY, SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

3.1 Methodology

The Competition Hub platform emerged from a comprehensive research methodology designed to address the challenges in modern competition management. Our approach combined both qualitative and quantitative methods to ensure a thorough understanding of user needs and technical requirements. Through structured interviews with stakeholders, including event organizers and participants, we gathered valuable insights into the pain points of existing competition management processes. Online surveys provided quantitative data from a broader user base, helping validate our assumptions and prioritize features.

The development process followed an iterative approach, allowing us to continuously refine the platform based on user feedback. We implemented a user-centered design philosophy, ensuring that every feature and interface element serves a specific purpose in enhancing the user experience. Regular feedback sessions with potential users helped shape the platform's evolution.

3.2 System Analysis
Our analysis revealed significant opportunities for improving competition management through digital transformation. Through careful examination of existing processes and user requirements, we identified several key areas where technology could streamline operations and enhance user experience.

3.2.1 Data Gathering Technique

The data gathering phase involved extensive interaction with stakeholders across different roles. Face-to-face interviews with event organizers provided deep insights into operational challenges, while online questionnaires helped understand participant expectations. We conducted observational studies of actual competition management processes, revealing inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement. Focus group discussions with diverse user groups helped validate our findings and gather additional perspectives.

3.2.2 Analysis of the Existing System
Current competition management systems primarily rely on manual processes, creating significant inefficiencies. Event organizers struggle with paper-based registration systems and spreadsheet-based participant tracking, leading to data entry errors and time-consuming administrative tasks. Communication largely depends on email, resulting in delayed updates and missed information. The registration workflow often involves multiple manual steps, creating bottlenecks in the process.

3.2.3 Advantages of the Existing System
Despite its limitations, the current system offers certain advantages that users appreciate. Its simplicity makes it accessible to users with limited technical expertise, and the direct personal interaction helps build relationships with participants. The system's flexibility allows for easy process modifications without technical constraints. Additionally, the low initial setup costs and minimal maintenance requirements make it cost-effective for smaller organizations.

3.2.4 Disadvantages of the Existing System
However, the disadvantages of the existing system significantly impact operational efficiency. Manual processes are time-consuming and prone to errors, while limited scalability hinders growth. The lack of real-time updates affects communication effectiveness, and poor data security poses risks to sensitive information. These limitations particularly affect larger events and organizations looking to expand their operations.

#### 3.2.5 High Level Model of the Proposed System

The investment in the Competition Hub platform is justified by both immediate and long-term benefits. The system's modern technology stack ensures scalability and future-proofing, while automated processes reduce operational costs. Enhanced user experience and improved data accuracy contribute to higher satisfaction levels, supporting sustainable growth.
3.3 System Design

The design phase focused on creating a robust and user-friendly platform that meets both current needs and future requirements. Our approach prioritized scalability, security, and user experience while ensuring technical excellence.

3.3.1 Objective of the Design

The primary objectives include creating an intuitive interface that simplifies competition management while ensuring system reliability and security. The design aims to support scalable growth while maintaining high performance and data integrity. These objectives directly address the challenges identified in our research.

3.3.2 System Architecture

We chose Flutter and Firebase as our core technologies for their robust capabilities and excellent integration features. The frontend leverages Flutter's cross-platform capabilities, while Firebase provides a secure and scalable backend infrastructure. This combination enables real-time updates, secure authentication, and reliable data storage.

3.3.3 Main Menu Design

The interface design prioritizes user experience through intuitive navigation and responsive layouts. The main menu provides easy access to key functions while maintaining consistency across different devices and platforms. Careful attention to accessibility ensures the platform serves all users effectively.
